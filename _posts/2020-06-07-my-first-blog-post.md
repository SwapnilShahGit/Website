After I started working full-time, I have found there is not a clear path forward in regards to becoming a better software engineer. Some might say that working as an engineer on a daily basis would do the trick. However, I believe it takes more then that as the technologies we work with on a daily basis are limited. Even the technologies we use daily, we only need to know them at a high level. Once we get the task done, we move on (which makes sense as there are business priorities).  For example, currently at work we primarily work with the Java Spring framework, Amazon Web Services Elastic Container Service, and Amazon Web Services Relational Database Service. I have no idea why this combination of technologies were chosen and I wanna get to know why. My thinking is maybe if I understand these technologies at a deeper level, I'll get to know the pros/cons and maybe understand why these specific technologies were chosen. Maybe I'll realize the decision was a coin flip, who knows? Eitherway, I'll get to learn more. 

Moving forward, my goal is to make a habit of picking a technology on a weekly basis and trying my best to write about the technology in a simple way. I am a firm believer that if you can't explain a concept at an introductory level, there is more learning to be had about it. I have already started following that as you'll notice I wrote "Amazon Web Services Elastic Container Service" instead of the usual "AWS KMS". I'll make it a point to write the full version of the acronym before continuing to use the acronym. I wish we did this more in the industry, there are too many acronyms (especially company specific) out there!

I got this idea from the following blogs that I would recommend you bookmark and read as well. There are some wonderful people out there writing to make peoples lives easier and these are just some.

I might have rambled on at times above, but forgive me, it's my first blog post. The writing will get better with practice :)
