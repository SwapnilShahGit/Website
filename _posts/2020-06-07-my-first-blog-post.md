After I started working full-time, I have found there is not a clear path forward in regards to becoming a better software engineer. Some might say that working as an engineer on a daily basis would do the trick. However, I believe it takes more then that as the technologies we work with on a daily basis are limited. Even the technologies we use daily, we only need to know them at a high level. Once we get the task done, we move on without needing to know the changes at a deeper level (which makes sense as there are business priorities).  For example, currently at work we primarily work with the Java Spring framework, Amazon Web Services Elastic Container Service, and Amazon Web Services Relational Database Service. I have no idea why this combination of technologies were chosen and I wanna get to know why. My thinking is maybe if I understand these technologies at a deeper level, I'll get to know the pros/cons and maybe understand why these specific technologies were chosen. Maybe I'll realize the decision was a coin flip, who knows? Eitherway, I'll get to learn more. 

Moving forward, my goal is to make a habit of picking a technology on a weekly basis and trying my best to write about the technology in a simple way. I am a firm believer that if you can't explain a concept at an introductory level, there is more learning to be had about it. I have already started following that as you'll notice I wrote "Amazon Web Services Elastic Container Service" instead of the usual "AWS KMS". I'll make it a point to write the full version of the acronym before continuing to use the acronym. I wish we did this more in the industry, there are too many acronyms (especially company specific) out there!

I chose the above goal because I have a general desire of being better and learning more. I have found that I have a bit of a lazy brain where if I don't need to know something for a task, I won't go out of my way to learn that. I think this is partly because of all the things I've constantly needed to learn in my undergrad and about the industry when I first started working. Now that I am two years in, I'm finding I have more free time to learn topics that I find interesting. But just simply opening up the documentation about a technology im curious about and reading the first page still leaves me at a high level of understanding. I need a more structured approach if I want to get more out this reading. So the goal of these posts is to write about them in hopes that I learn more by doing so and also help you, the reader, be introduced to some cool topics in Software Engineering.

I got this idea from the following blogs that I would recommend you bookmark and read as well. There are some wonderful people out there writing to make peoples lives easier and these are just some.

I might have rambled on at times above, but forgive me, it's my first blog post. The writing will get better with practice :)
